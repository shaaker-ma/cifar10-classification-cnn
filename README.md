# Neural Network Implementation and Analysis on CIFAR-10

This repository focuses on the implementation and analysis of neural networks for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. It explores various deep learning techniques, including data preprocessing, model design, training, optimization, and transfer learning.

## Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Custom convolutional neural network (CNN) design and implementation.
- Training and evaluation of models with various optimizers and hyperparameters.
- Performance visualization through accuracy and loss curves, confusion matrices, and more.
- Application of transfer learning with pre-trained models to enhance performance.

## Dataset
[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset to evaluate the performance of neural networks in image classification tasks.

## Results
- Plots of training and validation accuracy/loss.
- Analysis of different layer configurations and activation functions.
- Confusion matrices and classification reports.
